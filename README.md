# AssemblyEmulationProject
This assignment had the goal of making a virtual machine in Java. Each assignment was given weekly, building upon the week prior.  Final outcome is an emulation of a computer, that can take in various inputs despite having some simplicity for the sake of time constraints in assignments.
