# AssemblyEmulationProject
This assignment had the goal of making a virtual machine in Java. Each assignment was given weekly, building upon the week prior.  Final outcome is an emulation of a computer, that can take in various inputs despite having some simplicity for the sake of time constraints in assignments.

Attached are the 10 assignment pdfs. Detailing what had been required during each week. Followed with the final project after all 10 assignments had been completed.
